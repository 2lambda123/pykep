======================

pykep has been created by the pagmo development Team at the European Space Agency and was once part of the project  `pagmo/pygmo <https://github.com/esa/pagmo>`_. As of the release 1.0 of pagmo the decision was taken to move the entire keplerian_toolbox and its python alter-ego (pykep) to a different project and to keep supporting complete compatibility between the two projects.

pykep is in use at the European Space Agency's Advanced Concepts Team since 2006.

**Main Developers**:

Dario Izzo (madsax)

Francesco Biscani (bluescarni)
