Preparing your system for PyKEP
=================================

We assume you have root access to your unix machine. As PyKEP has some dependencies, you will need to install
a few packages before being able to install PyKEP on your machine. All are supported by most package managers,
so that a simple apt-get or emerge should suffice to prepare your system.


* Install `git <http://git-scm.com>`_
* Install `CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`_ with its ccmake utility
* Install `boost libraries <http://www.boost.org>`_
