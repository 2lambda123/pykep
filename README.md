=====

PyKEP is a scientific library providing basic tools to perform research in interplanetary trajectory design or, more
in geeral in mission analysis. Algoritmic efficiency is a main focus of the library,
which is written in C++ and exposed to Python
using the boost::python library. At the library core is the implementation of an efficient solver
for the multiple revolutions Lambertâ€™s problem, objects representing the Sims-Flanagan low-thrust model,
efficient keplerian propagators, Taylor-integrators and more ...
